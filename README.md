Mango Bruise Area Calculation
In the agricultural industry, finding bruised areas on mangoes with just the naked eye can be challenging, as many bruises are not easily visible. These hidden bruises can reduce the quality and market value of the fruit. The project Bruise Tracker aims to solve this problem by using computer vision technology to accurately detect and measure bruised areas that are hard to see. By providing precise calculations of the bruise-to-fruit ratio, bruise tracker offers important benefits for quality control and marketability. This technology automates the bruise detection process, making it more efficient, accurate, and reliable, and has the potential to improve fruit selection and reduce waste in the agricultural sector.
